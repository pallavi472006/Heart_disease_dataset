# Heart_disease_dataset
Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests Objective This project aims to implement tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease Dataset. The key objectives include:
Learning and applying the Decision Tree Classifier. Implementing the Random Forest Classifier. Conducting feature importance analysis. Controlling overfitting through the use of max_depth. Evaluating model performance using cross-validation. Tools & Libraries Used The following tools and libraries were utilized in this project:
Python Pandas Scikit-learn Matplotlib Seaborn Dataset The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease Dataset. It consists of 1,025 samples and 14 attributes, including:age sex cp (chest pain type) chol (cholesterol level) thalach (maximum heart rate) thal target: where 1 indicates the presence of heart disease and 0 indicates no disease. Key Results The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, while the Random Forest Classifier also reached an accuracy of 98.5%. A Decision Tree with a maximum depth of 3 resulted in a lower accuracy of 78.0%. Cross-validation results showed that the Random Forest model had a CV accuracy of 99.7%.
Feature Importances The Random Forest model identified several key features that significantly contribute to predictions, including:cp (chest pain type) ca (number of major vessels) thalach (maximum heart rate) oldpeak (ST depression) thal (thalassemia) Visuals The project includes visualizations such as a Decision Tree plot and a Feature Importance bar chart to illustrate the findings
